"""Execute every ```python block in README.md against the real API.

The bug class this catches is API drift in the docs: a method that moved to
module level, a constructor that no longer exists, arguments in the wrong
order. Those read fine and are wrong, and nothing else in the suite looks at
them. (remax found three such defects in its own README this way —
oaustegard/remax#63.)

remex's README blocks are illustrative rather than self-contained: they use
`embeddings`, `corpus`, `query` and friends without defining them. Rather
than rewrite the README into something less readable, the fixtures are
supplied here and the blocks run in document order in one shared namespace,
so names a block defines (`pq`, `compressed`) are visible to later blocks —
which is how a reader would build them up.

Fixtures are re-seeded at whatever `d` a block's own `Quantizer(d=...)`
declares, because the README legitimately switches dimension between
sections.
